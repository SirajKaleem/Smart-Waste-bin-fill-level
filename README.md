# Smart Waste Fill Level Prediction

## 📌 Project Description

Smart Waste Fill Level Prediction is a machine learning–based project designed to predict the fill level of waste bins. The system helps improve waste management by optimizing collection schedules, preventing bin overflow, reducing operational costs, and supporting smart city initiatives.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional waste collection systems operate on fixed schedules, which often lead to overflowing bins or unnecessary collections. This project addresses the issue by predicting waste bin fill levels in advance using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict waste bin fill levels accurately
* Reduce waste overflow problems
* Optimize waste collection schedules
* Support smart and sustainable city solutions

---

## ⭐ Features

* Machine learning–based prediction system
* Simple and user-friendly web interface
* Predicts waste bin fill level percentage
* Helps in efficient waste management planning

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
* Flask
* HTML & CSS
* Pandas & NumPy
* Joblib

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes information such as:

* Bin ID
* Location
* Usage patterns
* Historical fill level data

This data is used to train and test the machine learning model. (Synthetic / sample dataset is used for academic purposes.)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

The project uses a supervised machine learning model to predict the waste bin fill level percentage. The trained model is saved using Joblib and loaded during runtime for predictions.

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. User enters waste bin details through the web interface
2. Input data is processed by the system
3. Machine learning model predicts the fill level
4. Predicted result is displayed on the screen
