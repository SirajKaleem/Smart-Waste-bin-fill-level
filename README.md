# Smart-Waste-bin-fill-level
“This project implements a Smart Waste Fill Level Prediction system using machine learning. It predicts the fill percentage of waste bins based on input parameters such as bin ID, location, usage patterns, and time. The system helps optimize waste collection schedules, reduce overflow issues, and support smart city initiatives.”
